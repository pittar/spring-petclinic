## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is automatically exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` url.
 
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed. Note that whenever the database type is changed, the app needs to be run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySql.
